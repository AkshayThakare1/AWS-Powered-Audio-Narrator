# Step-by-Step Guide to Building Blog/Book Audio Converter using AWS Polly

### Project Description:

The Blog/Book Narrator project leverages AWS services to convert text files (such as blog posts, articles, newsletters, or book excerpts) into speech. This is particularly useful for creating audio versions of written content, making it accessible to a wider audience, including those who prefer listening over reading.

Use Cases: \

Content Accessibility: Provides audio versions of written content for visually impaired users. \
Learning: Enables users to listen to educational materials, enhancing learning experiences. \
Content Distribution: Offers 
an additional medium for content consumption, increasing engagement. \
Convenience: Allows users to listen to articles or books while multitasking, such as during commutes or workouts. \

### Steps to Build the Project:

* Step 1: Set Up an AWS Account 
* Step 2: Create two S3 Buckets (Source S3 Bucket Name: amc-polly-source-bucket, Destination S3 Bucket Name: amc-polly-destination-bucket) 
* Step 3: Create an IAM Policy (IAM Policy Name: amc-polly-lambda-policy)
  Policy Defination:

  ```bash
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::amc-polly-source-bucket/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::amc-polly-destination-bucket/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "polly:SynthesizeSpeech"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

* Step 4: Create a Subscription 
* Step 5: Create a Lambda Function (Lambda Function Name: ImageUploadProcessor) 
* Step 6: Add S3 trigger 
* Step 7: Write Lambda Function Code 
* Step 8: Test the System

### Expected Outcome:

By following these steps, you will have created a simple event-driven application on AWS that demonstrates the core principles of EDA. This setup can be expanded to more complex scenarios as you become more comfortable with the architecture and AWS services. If you need further assistance or have any questions, feel free to ask!

This project will help you improve your skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
